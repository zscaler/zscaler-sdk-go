// Submit: Submits raw or archive files (e.g., ZIP) to Sandbox for analysis. You can submit up to 100 files per day and it supports all file types that are currently supported by Sandbox. To learn more, see About Sandbox. By default, files are scanned by Zscaler antivirus (AV) and submitted directly to the sandbox in order to obtain a verdict. However, if a verdict already exists for the file, you can use the 'force' parameter to make the sandbox to reanalyze it.
// You must have a Sandbox policy rule configured within the ZIA Admin Portal in order to analyze files that aren't present in the default policy rule. Ensure that you have explicitly added Sandbox policy rules that include the appropriate file types within your request. If not, an 'Unknown' message is shown in the response.
// To learn more, see Configuring the Sandbox Policy and Configuring the Default Sandbox Rule.
// After files are sent for analysis, you must use GET /sandbox/report/{md5Hash} in order to retrieve the verdict. You can get the Sandbox report 10 minutes after a file is sent for analysis.
// SubmitFile submits a file for scanning and returns the result of the scan.
