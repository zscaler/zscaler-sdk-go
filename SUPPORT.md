# Support

This template/solution are released under an as-is, best effort, support
policy. These scripts should be seen as community supported and Zscaler
Business Development Team will contribute our expertise as and when possible.
We do not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components
of the project through our normal support options such as Zscaler support teams,
or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and backline
support options. The underlying product used (Zscaler Private Access API) but the
scripts or templates are still supported, but the support is only for the
product functionality and not for help in deploying or using the template or
script itself. Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/zscaler) or sites other
than our official [Downloads page](https://help.zscaler.com/login-tickets)
are provided under the best effort policy.
