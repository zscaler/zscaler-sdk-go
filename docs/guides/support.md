# General Support Statement

The Zscaler SDK GO is supported and maintained by the Zscaler Technology Alliances team, and we welcome questions on how to use this SDK.
Please, refer to our [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md) for guidance on typical problems.

## Support Ticket Severity

Support tickets related to the GO SDK can be opened with [Zscaler Support](https://help.zscaler.com/login-tickets), however since the SDK is just a client of the underlying product API, we will **NOT** be able to treat SDK related support requests as a Severity-1 (Immediate time frame).

When reporting bugs, please provide the script that demonstrates the bug and the command output. Stack traces will also be helpful.

Notice that we will **NOT**, however, fix bugs upon customer demand, as we have to prioritize all pending bugs and features, as part of the product's backlog and release cycles.

Urgent, production related SDK issues can be resolved via direct interaction with the underlying API or UI. We will ask customers to resort to these methods to resolve downtime or urgent issues. If you have an urgent escalation, please contact your local Zscaler account team (RSM/SE/CSM/TAM) for assistance.

## Contact

For questions or requests that cannot be submitted via GitHub Issues, please contact devrel@zscaler.com with "Zscaler-SDK-GO" in the subject line.
We also provide a [private Slack channel](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkd3EMkLQdIWMNQ7QCr8TrH_xVSwSYcQshfBPDEZFOaF28qA/viewform?usp=sf_link) where you can submit your questions to the SDK maintainers. Notice that this form will be reviewed and approved by Zscaler Technology Alliances team.
